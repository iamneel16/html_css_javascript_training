    <blockquote>
        “love is undying,of that I feel certain.I mean deep,abiding,cherishing love.The love that gives protection even as you,my guardian angel,gave me protection long after you had gone-and continue to give this very day...
        A love beyond Death-a love that makes Life alive!” - Ruskin Bond
